 Later releases
***********************************

BUGFIXES:

* Unable to test parts of JSSpec integration


REFACTORING:

* Split code into smaller parts with more limited responsibilities


FEATURES: 

* Integrate with qUnit: http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit
* Integrate with jsUnit: http://jsunit.net/
* Support grabbing deeper objects. Currently only one level.
* Report line numbers for failed expectations (may not be possible)

* Adapt Jack to be useable with env.js - http://ejohn.org/projects/bringing-the-browser-to-the-server
* Integrate Jack with Screw.Unit - http://github.com/nkallen/screw-unit/tree/master
* Find out how to handle calling of original functions
* Text reports for argument constraints:
* When reporting an expectation that was not met, report other calls to the same function.


***********************************
 "Verify" syntax -> 0.0.3
***********************************


* Implement a new jack.verify() syntax that can be called *after* execution instead of jack.expect() that needs to be called *before*
	- For objects created with jack.create();
	- For existsing, global objects
	
* (Details)
	- Rename "expectations" to "preparations"


***********************************
 Refactoring -> 0.0.2
***********************************


* Move matcing to jack.matchers.*
	- matching functions
		- DONE: is()
		- DONE: isNot()
		- DONE: isOneOf()
		- DONE: matches()
		- DONE: isType()
		- DONE: hasProperty()
		- DONE: hasProperties()
	- display values for "actual" and "expected"
		- DONE: is()
		- DONE: isNot()
		- DONE: matches()
		- DONE: isType()
		- DONE: hasProperty()
		- DONE: hasProperties()
		- DONE: isOneOf()
		- DONE: isLessThan()
		- DONE: isGreaterThan()

* Replace expectations in FunctionGrab with instances of FunctionInvocation
	- DONE: Implement "times"
	- DONE: Implement mock implementations
	- NEXT: More tests for FunctionGrab

* Rename "FunctionInvocation" to something more sensible...
    - DONE: now called FunctionSpecification



***********************************
 Alpha 0.0.1 - PLANNED
 -> Release on boss.bekk.no
***********************************

DONE:

* In JSSpec/IE, failing tests report errors multiple times. Also makes progress display > 100% when finished
* Text reports for argument constraints:
	- is()
	- isNot()
	- isOneOf()
* Verify working text reports for multiple expectations for same function
* Different mock implementations for multiple expectations
* Support specifying advanced argument constraints in expectations
* Integration with Scriptaculous test runner
* Text reporting for "at least", "at most" etc...
* Support setting multiple expectations for a function
* Refactor to storing separate invocation data
* Simple argument equality constraints
* Integration with JsSpec
* Support saving argument values for inspection
* Support specifying number of expected calls
	- atLeast(n)
	- atMost(n)
    - exactly(n)
	- once()
	- never()
* Support specifying a return object directly
    - example: ooo.returnValue(myValue)
    - instead of: ooo.mock(function(){return myValue})
* Support for mocking/stubbing any function or object with multiple function
