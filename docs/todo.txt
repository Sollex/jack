
BUGS:

* IE reports failed expectations multiple times
* Unable to test parts of JSSpec integration


FEATURES: 

* Verify working text reports for multiple expectations for same function
* Different mock implementations for multiple expectations
* Support for mocking/stubbing any function or object with multiple function
* Support specifying argument constraints in expectations
	- type
	- delegate constraints to function(arg) { return true/false; }
* Support specifying number of expected calls
	- never()

* Support specifying a return object directly
    - example: ooo.returnValue(myValue)
    - instead of: ooo.mock(function(){return myValue})
* Support grabbing deeper objects. Currently only one level.
* Integration with Scriptaculous test runner
* Report line numbers for failed expectations (may not be possible)


DONE:

* Text reporting for "at least", "at most" etc...
* Support setting multiple expectations for a function
* Refactor to storing separate invocation data
* Simple argument equality constraints
* Integration with JsSpec
* Support saving argument values for inspection
* Support specifying number of expected calls
	- atLeast(n)
	- atMost(n)
    - exactly(n)
	- once()
